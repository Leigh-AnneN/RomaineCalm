1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve? 
Keeping your plants alive
If you’re new to gardening, trying to keep track of what’s in your garden, or just trying to keep the plants you already have alive, this app is for you.

Romaine Calm is an extensive plant database, giving the search capability to find a vast array of plants and allow for various methods to sort the information. It has a feature that enables you to save information on the plants that you have in your house or garden, into the ‘My Garden” list and have a favourites list for future plant inspiration. 

The app has three elements:
Search Plants
Add plants to ‘My Garden’ (plants you already own) or to ‘Favourites’ (plants you like and might own in the future)
Exportable My Garden list (are you going on holiday, or moving house, export a list of plants for future residents so that they know what’s in their garden and how to take care of it)

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users? 
The type of user that will visit Romaine calm is anyone who is interested in gardening, has a garden small or large, inside or outside. Anyone new to gardening who has trouble keeping track of what needs to be done to keep their plants healthy. Will be more useful for people who have gardens.
